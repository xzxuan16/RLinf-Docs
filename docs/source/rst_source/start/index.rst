Quickstart
==========

Welcome to the RLinf Quickstart Guide. This section will walk you through launching RLinf for the first time. 
We present three concise examples to demonstrate the framework's workflow and help you get started quickly.

Available examples:

- Embodied training in the ManiSkill3 environment using the OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT models with the PPO algorithm (see :doc:`embody`)

- Mathematical training on the boba dataset using the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model with the GRPO algorithm (see :doc:`math`)

- Distributed multi-node training for mathematical tasks (see :doc:`distribute`)
