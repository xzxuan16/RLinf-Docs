Different RL tasks are mapped to different GPU groups according to their computation needs. There also two execution modes: the workers run sequentially one after another or the workers run concurrently with fine-grained pipelining.

**Pros**

* Flexible worker assignment.
* No requirement for offloading implementation.

**Cons**

* Data-flow dependencies lead to GPUs idle.  
* Pipelining should be implemented to reduce GPU idle time.

**Example configuration**

The workers are assigned to separate GPUs. The set of GPUs is specified using global GPU indices.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
     num_nodes: 2
     num_gpus_per_node: 8
     component_placement:
       rollout: 0-9
       inference: 10-11
       actor: 12-15

Currently, whether the execution is pipelined is decided by the underlying code implementation. We have not exposed the configuration option yet. If pipelining is implemented underlying, the disaggregated mode uses pipelining by default.

**ComponentPlacement programming**

As described in :doc:`collocated`, the placement configuration in the yaml file can be parsed by `ComponentPlacement` and enforced on workers. Refer to `Math RL training with pipelining <https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf/blob/main/examples/math/main_math_pipeline.py>`_ for the complete code.
