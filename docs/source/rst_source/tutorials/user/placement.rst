GPU Resource Placement Strategy
========================================

The placement module defines how workers are distributed across the hardware resources (nodes and GPUs) of the cluster. 
A **PlacementStrategy** encapsulates a particular policy for assigning workers to GPUs and nodes. 
This allows flexibility in how a set of workers (e.g., a `WorkerGroup`) utilizes the available GPUs. 
For each strategy, a list of `Placement` objects is returned by the `get_placement(num_gpus_per_node, isolate_gpu)` method. Each `Placement` includes:

+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Property                  | Description                                   |
+===========================+===============================================+
| `rank`                    | Unique global worker index                    | 
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `node_id`                 | Identifier of the node where the worker runs  |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `node_rank`               | Index of the node within the cluster          |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `local_gpu_id`            | GPU index assigned to the worker on that node |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `local_rank`              | Worker’s index among workers on the same node |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `local_world_size`        | Total number of workers on the same node      |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `cuda_visible_devices`    | List of GPU IDs visible to the worker         |
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| `isolate_gpu`             | Whether the worker is restricted to those GPUs|
+---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

.. Below are the provided strategies:

.. - **PackedPlacementStrategy** (default): This strategy places one worker per GPU in a simple “fill every GPU” order. It starts from a master node (default node 0) and assigns workers to GPUs 0,1,… on that node until it runs out of GPUs, then moves to the next node. 

.. .. Each worker gets a single GPU. If `isolate_gpu` is true, each worker will only see its one GPU; if false, the worker can see all GPUs on its node (though it is intended to primarily use the one it was assigned). The result is a list of placements where `rank` increases sequentially and corresponds directly to an absolute GPU index in the cluster. For example, with 2 nodes each having 4 GPUs, and 8 workers, ranks 0-3 might be on node 0’s GPUs 0-3, and ranks 4-7 on node 1’s GPUs 0-3. This close-packed strategy is the simplest and is the default when no specific placement is given.

.. - **ChunkedPlacementStrategy**: In this strategy, each **worker process can use multiple GPUs** as a chunk. You specify `num_gpus_per_process` (the size of the chunk). The strategy will allocate workers such that each worker has a contiguous block of GPUs on a node. 

.. .. For example, if `num_gpus_per_process=2` on a node with 8 GPUs, a single worker could be assigned GPUs [0,1], the next worker [2,3], and so on. It effectively reduces the number of processes by grouping GPUs into chunks for each process. This strategy requires `isolate_gpu=True` to function correctly (ensuring a process only “sees” its chunk of GPUs). The placement algorithm for chunked strategy calculates a global GPU index for each process (rank * num_gpus_per_process) and derives the node and local GPU indices from that. It stops when it reaches the total number of nodes or cannot fit another full chunk on the remaining GPUs. The `Placement` entries for chunked workers will list multiple CUDA devices in the `cuda_visible_devices` field (equal to the chunk size). This is useful for scenarios like data parallel training where each worker might leverage multiple GPUs internally (e.g., model parallelism within a single worker).

.. - **StridedPlacementStrategy**: This strategy also allows multiple GPUs per process but distributes them in a strided pattern across the GPU indices. It takes parameters `stride` and `num_gpus_per_process`. The GPUs are conceptually divided into groups, each group spanning a number of GPUs equal to `stride * num_gpus_per_process`. Within each group, GPUs are assigned to workers such that there is a fixed stride between the GPUs of consecutive workers. 

.. .. For example, consider 1 node with 8 GPUs, `num_gpus_per_process=2` and `stride=2`: GPUs can be thought of as indexed 0..7. The strategy will form groups of size `stride * num_gpus_per_process = 2*2 = 4` GPUs. Group 0 might cover GPUs 0-3 and group 1 covers GPUs 4-7. Within each group, workers are created such that worker 0 takes GPUs [0,2] and worker 1 takes GPUs [1,3] (stride of 2 between GPUs in the same worker). In group 1, worker 2 takes [4,6], worker 3 takes [5,7]. The effect is interleaving GPU assignments among workers. Strided placement can be useful for certain parallel algorithms that prefer evenly spaced GPU indices, or when trying to avoid neighboring GPUs being on the same worker due to hardware locality or bandwidth considerations. This strategy also demands `isolate_gpu=True`, and it ensures that each process’s GPUs respect the stride and count constraints. The number of workers created will be `(num_nodes * num_gpus_per_node) / (stride * num_gpus_per_process)` (which should be an integer—if it’s not, the strategy configuration is invalid for the given cluster size).

.. - **FineGrainedPackedPlacementStrategy**: This strategy allows precise selection of how many GPUs to use in total and from where to start. It is useful when you want to run a job on a subset of the cluster’s GPUs rather than all available ones. The strategy will allocate workers on GPUs starting from the specified `master_node` and `master_gpu`, then continue sequentially (as if using packed strategy) until it has assigned `num_gpus` workers.

.. .. It takes `master_node` (the starting node index, default 0), `master_gpu` (the starting GPU index on that master node), and `num_gpus` (the total number of GPUs to utilize across the cluster). The strategy will allocate workers on GPUs starting from the specified `master_node` and `master_gpu`, then continue sequentially (as if using packed strategy) until it has assigned `num_gpus` workers. For example, if `master_node=0, master_gpu=2, num_gpus=3` on a cluster where each node has 4 GPUs, this would create workers on GPU 2 and GPU 3 of node 0, and then GPU 0 of node 1 (assuming node 0 had only 2 GPUs left after starting at index 2). Each worker is one GPU (similar to packed), but the total world size is limited to `num_gpus`. This strategy can be combined with `isolate_gpu=False` if you want each worker to still see all GPUs on its node (though typically one might isolate anyway for consistency). Fine-grained placement is essentially a “partial packed” strategy for cases where you don’t want to use the entire cluster or want to offset where usage begins.


PackedPlacementStrategy
-----------------------

This strategy places processes onto GPUs in a close-packed, contiguous fashion.

**Required inputs**

- ``master_node`` — start node
- One of ``num_nodes`` or ``num_processes`` (mutually exclusive)
- ``master_gpu`` — start GPU on the master node
- ``num_gpus_per_process`` — contiguous GPUs per process
- ``isolate_gpu`` — Whether the worker is restricted to those GPUs

**Placement principle**

Starting at ``(master_node, master_gpu)``, the scheduler assigns each process a contiguous block of size ``num_gpus_per_process`` on the current node, 
moving linearly across GPU indices. When a node’s GPUs are exhausted, 
it advances to the next node. If ``num_nodes`` is provided, the total ``num_processes`` is derived from available GPUs and the per-process width. 
Optionally, ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` is set so each process only “sees” its assigned GPUs.

**Purpose**

A straightforward default placement strategy that aligns with frameworks expecting contiguous device IDs per process, 
while also allowing execution from an offset subset specified by ``(master_node, master_gpu)`` without occupying the entire cluster.


StridedPlacementStrategy
------------------------

This strategy assigns multiple GPUs per process in a fixed-stride pattern (e.g., ``0, 2, 4`` for stride 2), spreading a process’s devices across the node’s GPU index space.

**Required inputs**

- ``master_node`` — start node
- ``num_nodes`` — span of nodes starting at master
- ``stride`` — GPU index stride
- ``num_gpus_per_process`` — GPUs per process
- ``isolate_gpu`` — must be ``True`` (enforced)

**Placement principle**

The total GPU pool over the selected nodes is conceptually partitioned into equal “groups” of size ``stride × num_gpus_per_process``. Within each group, ``stride`` processes are interleaved, and each process receives GPUs ``[g, g+stride, …]``. Groups are then tightly filled across nodes, subject to divisibility and fit constraints to ensure every process’s last GPU index is in range.

**Purpose**

Useful to colocation placement of rollout and training models that places model parallel source ranks on the same GPUs, enabling fast zero-copy-cudaIPC-based weight synchronization

Summary
--------

In summary, the **placement** component ensures that workers are deployed in a way that matches the desired parallel execution pattern and resource usage policy, which is crucial for performance and correctness in distributed training.
